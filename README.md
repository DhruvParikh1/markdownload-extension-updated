# MarkSnip - Markdown Web Clipper

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/DhruvParikh1/markdownload-extension-updated?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)](https://github.com/DhruvParikh1/markdownload-extension-updated/releases/latest)

This is a fork of the [MarkDownload](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload) extension with new functionality that made it easier for myself to use with LLMs like ChatGPT and Anthropic-Claude. The major changes are support for prettier tables, and coming soon is a functionality to input a few links and get the markdown of all of them. It allows you to clip websites and download them as readable Markdown files. Please keep in mind that it may not work perfectly on all websites.

To use this extension:

1. Click the extension icon while browsing the page you want to save 
2. A popup will display the rendered Markdown which you can edit or copy
3. Click the download button to save the content as a .md file
4. Selecting text on the page will allow you to download just the selected portion
